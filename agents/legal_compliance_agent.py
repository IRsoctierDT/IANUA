"""Legal/Compliance Research Agent.

Structures a legal or compliance inquiry into a reviewable intake: it classifies
the topic area, flags whether escalation to counsel is required, and produces a
*research checklist* of authority categories to verify — plus recommended next
steps and a mandatory disclaimer.

What this agent deliberately does NOT do (AGENTS.md §5, §9; governance rules):
- It does **not** provide legal advice or legal conclusions.
- It does **not** invent or assert statutes, case law, deadlines, or citations.
  The authority checklist names *categories to research and verify*, never a claim
  that a specific law applies to the user's facts.
- It does **not** send, file, or publish anything. Drafting only; humans act.

It is a drafting and triage aid whose output is meant to be handed to a qualified
attorney, not relied on directly.
